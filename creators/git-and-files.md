## File Synchronization

Unique to AmadeusWebWorld, in this section, we will describe the use of

* Git for file management
* FTPUploader for moving to server and it's feature:
* CDN Manager for large files not needed to be in Git

## Autodetect & Content-available

By using GitHub, we will easily pull up repositories / display them.

We assume all content and websites are given in the same **source/content available** manner as this **proprietary** system.
